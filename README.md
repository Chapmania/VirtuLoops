# VirtuLoops

VirtuLoops is a virtual reality loop-based music creation environment, built for room-scale VR on the HTC Vive. It was built using Unity v2019.2.9, SteamVR, and Max/MSP v8.0.

VirtuLoops provides a new and innovative schematic for music creation in virtual reality. Rather than relying on Unity's sound engine, which is limited to static and deterministic playback, VirtuLoops routes all sound in real time to Max's audio engine. Unity and Max are able to communicate via OSC messages sent over a local network, such that player and game events in Unity trigger audio events in Max, and likewise, audio in Max triggers events and visual feedback in Unity. 

VirtuLoops was designed to be immediately accesible and usable by all levels of users, even if they have no prior experience with music production or virtual reality. Players can interact with instruments in various ways, such as hitting pads with mallets, moving sliders along a fretboard, or picking up cubes that represent drum loops. Sounds can also be manipualted in real time via the Touchpad on the Vive controller, and by rotating the controller.
